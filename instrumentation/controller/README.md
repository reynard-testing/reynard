# Instrumentation controller

## Endpoints
The controller is an API server that has the following endpoints:

### Test library endpoints

| URL | Method | Description |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| `/v1/faultload/register` | `POST`  | Register a `trace_id` at all proxies, to track it.
| `/v1/trace/{trace_id}` | `GET`  | Get the list of reports for a registered `trace_id`.
| `/v1/faultload/unregister` | `POST`  | Remove a `trace_id`.
| `/v1/clear` | `GET`  | Clear everything.

### Proxy endpoints

| URL | Method | Description |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| `/v1/proxy/report` | `POST`  | Upsert operation to define a report for a `span_id` and `trace_id`.
| `/v1/proxy/get-uid` | `POST`  | Get a fault uid, based on the metadata available to the proxy.


## Configuration

The environment can be configured using environment variables:

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | ------ | ----------- |
| `CONTROLLER_PORT` | `5000`  | The port on which the API is exposed.
| `PROXY_LIST` | `""`  | Comma seperated list of control API adresses of the proxies.
| `PROXY_TIMEOUT` | `100`  | Max timeout before retrying requests to proxies.
| `PROXY_RETRY_COUNT` | `3`  | Max number of retries to attempt when sending requests to proxies.
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info`  | Log level:  `error`, `warn`, `info` or `debug`.
| `USE_OTEL` | `false`  | Whether to use OTel internally.

If `USE_OTEL` is set to `true`, you can configure [OpenTelemetry configurations](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/) in the environment too.
